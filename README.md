# KLM52Z Microprocessor Projects

This repository contains C codes to implement various projects on KLM52Z microprocessors. These projects involve working with 7-segment displays, implementing counters, rolling and fading displays, and intensity variation.

## Projects

### 1. Counter to 99
- Implements a counter that counts up from 0 to 99 and displays the count on a 7-segment display.

### 2. Timer from 99
- Implements a counter that counts down from 99 to 0 and displays the count on a 7-segment display.

### 3. Rolling Display
- Implements a rolling display effect on a 7-segment display, where the numbers continuously roll from one end to the other.

### 4. 7 digit Fading Display with Intensity Variation
- Implements a fading display effect on a 7-segment display, where the intensity of the displayed numbers gradually fades in and out.

### 5. Potentiometer controlled ADC with input and output datastreams 
- The Potentiometer Controlled ADC project allows the microcontroller to interface with a potentiometer, read its analog input, and convert it to digital form using an ADC. The digital data is then transmitted as a data stream to a computer for processing. The computer analyzes the data and sends back an output data stream to control external devices connected to the microcontroller.

### 6. Data Streams
-project allows the KLM52Z microprocessor to communicate with a computer using a data stream. The microprocessor sends a data stream to the computer, and the computer processes the data and sends it back to the microprocessor. The received data is then displayed on the computer interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KLM52Z-microprocessor-projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd KLM52Z-microprocessor-projects
```

3. Open the desired project's C code file in your preferred IDE or text editor.

4. Compile and upload the code to your KLM52Z microprocessor board using the appropriate toolchain and development environment.

5. Connect the 7-segment display to the appropriate pins on the microprocessor board according to the project's specifications.

6. Power on the microprocessor board and observe the project in action.
